JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Tools: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, D3.js

In order to display UFO eye-witness reports in a readable and filterable way on a webpage, I have taken an array of JavaScript objects (data.js) and used Object.entries() to return an array of key-value pairs and added it to the table on the page. 

Then I built a button for users to filter the data by dates by removing all previous entries and then adding each of the key-value pairs that match the user-supplied date to the webpage.
